# Create two variables, each of which is half of a compound sentence. Do NOT add any punctuation up front. Add the two variables together, and print the result.
## Example compound sentence: "I'll go to the beach today, and I'll go snorkeling." 

part_1 = "For dinner we had soup"
part_2 = "and for dessert we had ice cream."

full_sentence = (part_1 + " " + part_2)
